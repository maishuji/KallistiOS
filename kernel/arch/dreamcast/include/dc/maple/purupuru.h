/** \file    dc/maple/purupuru.h
    \brief   Definitions for using the Puru Puru (Jump) Pack.
    \ingroup peripherals_rumble

    This file contains the definitions needed to access maple jump pack devices.
    Puru Puru was Sega's internal name for the device, hence why its referred to
    in this way here.

    This driver is largely based off of information provided by Kamjin on the
    DCEmulation forums. See
    http://dcemulation.org/phpBB/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=48462 if you're interested
    in the original documentation.

    Also, its important to note that not all Jump Packs are created equal. Some
    of the stuff in here does not do what it seems like it should on many
    devices. The "decay" setting, for instance, does not seem to work on Sega
    Puru Purus, and actually makes most (if not all) effects do absolutely
    nothing. Basically, its all a big guess-and-test game to get things to work
    the way you might like. Don't be surprised if you manage to set up something
    that does absolutely nothing on the first try.
